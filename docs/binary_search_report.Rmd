title: "Binary Search: Correctness and Performance"

## Overview

Binary Search is a classical algorithm with logarithmic time complexity, O(log n),
assuming a sorted input array.

In this project, the algorithm is implemented explicitly in R, closely mirroring
its original Pascal and C implementations, without relying on built-in helpers.

---

## Algorithm Description

The algorithm maintains two boundaries (`start` and `end`) and repeatedly narrows
the search interval by comparing the target value with the middle element.

Integer arithmetic is used explicitly to compute the midpoint.

---

## Correctness

Correctness is verified using automated tests covering:

- empty arrays
- single-element arrays
- boundary values
- missing elements
- duplicated values

These tests ensure predictable behavior across edge cases.

---

## Benchmark

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
source("../modern_r/R/binary_search.R")

set.seed(42)
array <- sort(sample(1:1000000, 100000))
target <- array[50000]

microbenchmark(
  binary_search_custom = binary_search(array, target),
  base_match = match(target, array),
  times = 100
)
```

---

## Conclusion

The custom implementation behaves correctly and exhibits logarithmic performance.
While not intended to outperform optimized built-ins, it serves as a clear and
reproducible baseline for algorithmic reasoning and benchmarking.
