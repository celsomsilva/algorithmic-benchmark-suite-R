## Overview

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm with quadratic
time complexity, O(n²).

Although inefficient for large datasets, it is widely used for educational
purposes due to its straightforward control flow.

---

## Algorithm Description

The algorithm repeatedly traverses the array, swapping adjacent elements
whenever they are out of order.

This implementation mirrors a classic C version using explicit nested loops
and a temporary variable for swapping.

---

## Correctness

Automated tests verify:

- empty vectors
- single-element vectors
- already sorted inputs
- reverse-ordered inputs
- duplicated values

These tests ensure correctness despite the algorithm’s simplicity.

## Benchmark

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
source("../modern_r/R/bubble_sort.R")

set.seed(42)
array <- sample(1:1000, 100)

microbenchmark(
  bubble_sort_custom = bubble_sort(array),
  base_sort = sort(array),
  times = 50
)
```

## Conclusion

Bubble Sort is not competitive with optimized sorting routines.
Its value lies in exposing algorithmic cost, control flow, and the
impact of quadratic complexity in practice.
